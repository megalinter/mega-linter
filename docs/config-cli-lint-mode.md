# CLI lint mode

Each linter has a lint mode by default, visible in its MegaLinter documentation ([example](https://megalinter.io/latest/descriptors/repository_trivy/#how-the-linting-is-performed)):

- `list_of_files`: All files are sent in single call to the linter
- `project`: The linter is called from the root of the project, without specifying any file name
- `file`: The linter is called once by file (so the performances may not be very good)

You can override the CLI_LINT_MODE by using configuration variable for each linter (see [linters documentation](https://megalinter.io/supported-linters/))

- Linters with `file` default lint mode can not be overridden to `list_of_files`
- Linters with `project` default lint mode can not be overridden to `list_of_files` or `file`

Allowing `file` or `list_of_files` to be overridden to `project` is mostly for workarounds, for example with linters that have a problem to find their config file when the current folder isn't the repo root.

Special considerations:

- As list of files isn't sent to the linter command, linters using `project` lint mode don't take in account some variables like FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE and FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE. For those linters, you must check their documentation to define ignore configuration as it's awaited by the linter (for example with a `.secretlintignore` file for secretlint)
