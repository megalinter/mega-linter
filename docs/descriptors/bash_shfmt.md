### shfmt configuration

- shfmt has no known capability to configure custom rules
- shfmt has no known capability to inline-disable rules

### Mega-linter configuration

- Enable shfmt by adding `BASH_SHFMT` in [ENABLE_LINTERS variable](https://github.com/nvuillam/mega-linter#activation-and-deactivation)
- Disable shfmt by adding `BASH_SHFMT` in [DISABLE_LINTERS variable](https://github.com/nvuillam/mega-linter#activation-and-deactivation)

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| BASH_SHFMT_ARGUMENTS | User custom arguments to add in linter CLI call<br/>Ex: `-s --foo "bar"` |  |
| BASH_SHFMT_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE | Custom regex including filter<br/>Ex: `\/(src\|lib)\/` | Include every file |
| BASH_SHFMT_FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE | Custom regex excluding filter<br/>Ex: `\/(test\|examples)\/` | Exclude no file |
| BASH_SHFMT_DISABLE_ERRORS | Run linter but disable crash if errors found | `false` |

## Behind the scenes

### How are identified applicable files

- File extensions:
  - `.sh`
  - `.bash`
  - `.dash`
  - `.ksh`


### Example calls

```shell
shfmt -d myfile.sh
```


### Help content

```shell
usage: shfmt [flags] [path ...]

If the only argument is a dash ('-') or no arguments are given, standard input
will be used. If a given path is a directory, it will be recursively searched
for shell files - both by filename extension and by shebang.

  -version  show version and exit

  -l        list files whose formatting differs from shfmt's
  -w        write result to file instead of stdout
  -d        error with a diff when the formatting differs
  -s        simplify the code
  -mn       minify the code to reduce its size (implies -s)

Parser options:

  -ln str   language variant to parse (bash/posix/mksh, default "bash")
  -p        shorthand for -ln=posix

Printer options:

  -i uint   indent: 0 for tabs (default), >0 for number of spaces
  -bn       binary ops like && and | may start a line
  -ci       switch cases will be indented
  -sr       redirect operators will be followed by a space
  -kp       keep column alignment paddings
  -fn       function opening braces are placed on a separate line

Utilities:

  -f        recursively find all shell files and print the paths
  -tojson   print syntax tree to stdout as a typed JSON

```
