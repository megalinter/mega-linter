```


### Help content

```shell
usage: shfmt [flags] [path ...]

If the only argument is a dash ('-') or no arguments are given, standard input
will be used. If a given path is a directory, it will be recursively searched
for shell files - both by filename extension and by shebang.

  -version  show version and exit

  -l        list files whose formatting differs from shfmt's
  -w        write result to file instead of stdout
  -d        error with a diff when the formatting differs
  -s        simplify the code
  -mn       minify the code to reduce its size (implies -s)

Parser options:

  -ln str   language variant to parse (bash/posix/mksh, default "bash")
  -p        shorthand for -ln=posix

Printer options:

  -i uint   indent: 0 for tabs (default), >0 for number of spaces
  -bn       binary ops like && and | may start a line
  -ci       switch cases will be indented
  -sr       redirect operators will be followed by a space
  -kp       keep column alignment paddings
  -fn       function opening braces are placed on a separate line

Utilities:

  -f        recursively find all shell files and print the paths
  -tojson   print syntax tree to stdout as a typed JSON
