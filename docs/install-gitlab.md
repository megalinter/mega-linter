# GitLab CI

## Manual setup

Create or update `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository

```yaml
# MegaLinter GitLab CI job configuration file
# More info at https://megalinter.io/

mega-linter:
  stage: test
  # You can override MegaLinter flavor used to have faster performances
  # More info at https://megalinter.io/flavors/
  image: oxsecurity/megalinter:v7
  script: [ "true" ] # if script: ["true"] doesn't work, you may try ->  script: [ "/bin/bash /entrypoint.sh" ]
  variables:
    # All available variables are described in documentation
    # https://megalinter.io/configuration/
    DEFAULT_WORKSPACE: $CI_PROJECT_DIR
    # ADD YOUR CUSTOM ENV VARIABLES HERE TO OVERRIDE VALUES OF .mega-linter.yml AT THE ROOT OF YOUR REPOSITORY
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - megalinter-reports
    expire_in: 1 week
```

Create a Gitlab access token and define it in a variable **GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_MEGALINTER** in the project CI/CD masked variables. Make sure your token (e.g. if a project token) as the appropriate [role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) for commenting a merge request (at least developer).

Our friends at [R2Devops](https://r2devops.io/) have packaged a [Gitlab-CI MegaLinter workflow](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/mega_linter) on their [open-source templates marketplace](https://r2devops.io/marketplace), and it can post MegaLinter results in Gitlab Code Quality Reports !
