# Flavors

_This capability is in **Beta version**_

To improve run performances, we generate **Flavored Mega-Linter images** containing only the list of linters related to a project type

- When using default Mega-Linter, if a Mega-Linter Flavor would cover all your project requirements, a message is added in the logs
- If your project uses a Mega-Linter Flavor not covering linter requirements, an error message will be thrown with instructions about how to solve the issue
