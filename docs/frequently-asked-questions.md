# Frequently Asked Questions

> My repo CI already have linters and they are perfectly working, so why do I need Mega-Linter ?

You can perfectly continue using your installed linters and deactivate them in .mega-linter.yml. For example, in a javascript project using eslint, you can configure Mega-Linter with `DISABLE: JAVASCRIPT`. That way, you will benefit from both your installed linters but also from other Mega-Linter linters like JSON, YAML, Markdown, Dockerfile and Bash linters
