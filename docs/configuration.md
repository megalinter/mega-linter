# Configuration

MegaLinter configuration variables can be defined in a **.mega-linter.yml** file at the root of the repository or with **environment variables**.
You can see an example config file in this repo: [**.mega-linter.yml**](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/.mega-linter.yml)

Configuration is assisted with auto-completion and validation in most commonly used IDEs, thanks to [JSON schema](https://megalinter.github.io/json-schemas/configuration.html) stored on [schemastore.org](https://www.schemastore.org/)

- VSCode: You need a VSCode extension like [Red Hat YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
- IDEA family: Auto-completion natively supported

## Activation and deactivation

MegaLinter have all linters enabled by default, but allows to enable only some, or disable only some

- If `ENABLE` is not set, all descriptors are activated by default. If set, all linters of listed descriptors will be activated by default
- If `ENABLE_LINTERS` is set, only listed linters will be processed
- If `DISABLE` is set, the linters in the listed descriptors will be skipped
- If `DISABLE_LINTERS` is set, the listed linters will be skipped
- If `DISABLE_ERRORS_LINTERS` is set, the listed linters will be run, but if errors are found, they will be considered as non blocking

Examples:

- Run all javascript and groovy linters except STANDARD javascript linter. DevSkim errors will be non-blocking

```yaml
ENABLE: JAVASCRIPT,GROOVY
DISABLE_LINTERS: JAVASCRIPT_STANDARD
DISABLE_ERRORS_LINTERS: REPOSITORY_DEVSKIM
```

- Run all linters except PHP linters (PHP_BUILTIN, PHP_PHPCS, PHP_PHPSTAN, PHP_PSALM)

```yaml
DISABLE: PHP
```

- Run all linters except PHP_PHPSTAN and PHP_PSALM linters

```yaml
DISABLE_LINTERS: 
  - PHP_PHPSTAN
  - PHP_PSALM
```

## Filter linted files

If you need to lint only a folder or exclude some files from linting, you can use optional environment parameters `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` and `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE`
You can apply filters to a single linter by defining variable `<LINTER_KEY>_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` and `<LINTER_KEY>_FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE`

Examples:

- Lint only src folder: `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE: (src/)`
- Do not lint files inside test and example folders: `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE: (test/|examples/)`
- Do not lint javascript files inside test folder: `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE: (test/.*\.js)`

Warning: not applicable with linters using CLI lint mode `project` ([see details](#cli-lint-mode))

## Apply fixes

Mega-linter is able to apply fixes provided by linters. To use this capability, you need 3 **env variables** defined at top level

- **APPLY_FIXES**: `all` to apply fixes of all linters, or a list of linter keys (ex: `JAVASCRIPT_ES`,`MARKDOWN_MARKDOWNLINT`)

Only for GitHub Action Workflow file if you use it:

- **APPLY_FIXES_EVENT**: `all`, `push`, `pull_request`, `none` _(use none in case of use of [Updated sources reporter](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md))_
- **APPLY_FIXES_MODE**: `commit` to create a new commit and push it on the same branch, or `pull_request` to create a new PR targeting the branch.

Notes:

- You can use [**Updated sources reporter**](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md) if you do not want fixes to be automatically applied on git branch, but **download them in a zipped file** and manually **extract them in your project**
- If used, **APPLY_FIXES_EVENT** and **APPLY_FIXES_MODE** can not be defined in `.mega-linter.yml`config file, they must be set as environment variables

- If you use **APPLY_FIXES**, add the following line in your `.gitignore file`

```shell
megalinter-reports/
```

- You may see **github permission errors**, or workflows not run on the new commit. To solve these issues:
  - [Create Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token), then copy the PAT value
  - [Define secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named **PAT** on your repository, and paste the PAT value

## Linter specific variables

See variables related to a single linter behavior in [linters documentations](supported-linters.md)

## Pre-commands

MegaLinter can run custom commands before running linters (for example, installing an plugin required by one of the linters you use)

Example in `.mega-linter.yml` config file

```yaml
PRE_COMMANDS:
  - command: npm install eslint-plugin-whatever
    cwd: "root"        # Will be run at the root of MegaLinter docker image
  - command: echo "pre-test command has been called"
    cwd: "workspace"   # Will be run at the root of the workspace (usually your repository root)
  - command: pip install flake8-cognitive-complexity
    venv: flake8 # Will be run within flake8 python virtualenv. There is one virtualenv per python-based linter, with the same name
```

## Post-commands

MegaLinter can run custom commands after running linters (for example, running additional tests)

Example in `.mega-linter.yml` config file

```yaml
POST_COMMANDS:
  - command: npm run test
    cwd: "workspace"   # Will be run at the root of the workspace (usually your repository root)
```

## CLI lint mode

Each linter has a lint mode by default, visible in its MegaLinter documentation ([example](https://megalinter.io/latest/descriptors/repository_trivy/#how-the-linting-is-performed)):

- `list_of_files`: All files are sent in single call to the linter
- `project`: The linter is called from the root of the project, without specifying any file name
- `file`: The linter is called once by file (so the performances may not be very good)

You can override the CLI_LINT_MODE by using configuration variable for each linter (see [linters documentation](https://megalinter.io/supported-linters/))

- Linters with `file` default lint mode can not be overridden to `list_of_files`
- Linters with `project` default lint mode can not be overridden to `list_of_files` or `file`

Allowing `file` or `list_of_files` to be overridden to `project` is mostly for workarounds, for example with linters that have a problem to find their config file when the current folder is not the repo root.

Special considerations:

- As list of files is not sent to the linter command, linters using `project` lint mode do not take in account some variables like FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE and FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE. For those linters, you must check their documentation to define ignore configuration as it is awaited by the linter (for example with a `.secretlintignore` file for secretlint)
