# File.io Reporter

IF you don't use artifacts upload to read Mega-Linter reports, you can access them with an hyperlink to file.io

**important**: Mega-Linter has no affiliation with file.io, but it's supposed to be secured, and only one download is available for a report (snapchat for files, basically)

This reporter **is deactivated by default**.

## Usage

Activate the reporter (`FILEIO_REPORTER: true`) to see link to reports zip on file.io

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| ----------------- | -------------- | :--------------: |
| FILEIO_REPORTER | Activates/deactivates reporter | false |
