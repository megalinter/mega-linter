## Open-source teams

MegaLinter obviously would not exist without its linters and libraries, so many thanks to all the dedicated Open-Source teams maintaining all these awesome linters !

## Super-Linter team

MegaLinter has been built on the ashes of a [rejected Pull Request](https://github.com/github/super-linter/pull/791){target=_blank} on [GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter){target=_blank}.

Even if I disagree with their decision to remain in bash, the core team has always been nice and supporting [during the time I was a Super-Linter contributor](https://github.com/github/super-linter/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Anvuillam+review%3Aapproved){target=_blank} :)
