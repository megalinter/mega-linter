# GitHub Action

1. Create a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/mega-linter.yml`
2. Copy the [example workflow from below](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/main/TEMPLATES/mega-linter.yml) into that new file, no extra configuration required
3. Commit that file to a new branch
4. Open up a pull request and observe the action working
5. Enjoy your more _stable_, and _cleaner_ code base

**NOTES:**

- If you pass the _Environment_ variable `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` in your workflow, then the **MegaLinter** will mark the status of each individual linter run in the Checks section of a pull request. Without this you will only see the overall status of the full run. There is no need to set the **GitHub** Secret as it's automatically set by GitHub, it only needs to be passed to the action.
- You can also **use it outside of GitHub Actions** (CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins, GitLab, or even locally with a docker run) , and have status on Github Pull Request if `GITHUB_TARGET_URL` environment variable exists.
